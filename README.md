# Elephant Sensory Kids Toy

This repo contains the source for a sensory kids toy that runs on a arduino nano. This project was developed in VS Code using Platform IO. This project came about after seeing friends kids use sensory toys and my growing stash of switches and random LED's. A good excuse to throw old 1 off parts together.

The elephant was cut out of ash and mahogany wood using a snapmaker CNC carver. Cutouts were made for a 8x8 LED matrix, 3 toggle switches, and 1 button. Inside there is an arduino nano, haptic motor, charge controller, and a handful of 74hc595 shift registers.
